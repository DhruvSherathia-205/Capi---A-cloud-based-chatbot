**Capi - A cloud based chatbot**


**Abstract:** This project is to develop a chatbot which answers any queries posted by students like professorâ€™s contact details, course related questions, location of university buildings etc. It is a text-based conversation. We have used Python as a backend language , with help of flask Freamework. This system will be a WEB application which could be added to any college's(e.g., Lambton college in our case) website which will reply to queries of students very well.
